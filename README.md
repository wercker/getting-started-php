# Getting started PHP sample application

This is a small php application to demonstrate PHP support at wercker. It manages its dependencies via Composer and contains an integration test that is executed with PHPUnit. The CI build pipeline is defined in the [wercker.yml](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-php/blob/master/wercker.yml) file.
